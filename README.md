# Microservices Project

This repository contains a microservices-based application leveraging Java for backend services and Vue.js for the frontend. The project demonstrates best practices in building scalable, maintainable, and modular distributed systems. It also includes supporting scripts and infrastructure components.

## Overview

This project is designed to illustrate microservices principles by splitting functionality across independently deployable services. Each service has a clear responsibility and communicates with others via APIs.

## Architecture

- **Backend:** Multiple Java-based microservices
- **Frontend:** Vue.js SPA (Single Page Application)
- **API Communication:** RESTful APIs (JSON)
- **Scripts:** PowerShell scripts for automation and setup

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot or similar)
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, JavaScript
- **Scripting/DevOps:** PowerShell
- **Other:** (add any database, message queue, or additional tools you use)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11+ and Maven/Gradle
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- PowerShell (for setup scripts)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moheie/Microservices-Project-moheie.git
   cd Microservices-Project-moheie
   ```

2. **Backend:**
   - Navigate to each service directory and build:
     ```bash
     cd backend/service-1
     ./mvnw clean install
     # or
     ./gradlew build
     ```

3. **Frontend:**
   - Install dependencies and run:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     npm run serve
     ```

4. **Scripts:**
   - Use PowerShell scripts in the `scripts/` directory for automation.

## Building and Running

- **Start all backend services:**  
  Run each Java microservice, either directly or via Docker Compose (if provided).

- **Start frontend:**  
  Run the Vue.js app and access via `http://localhost:8080` (default).

## Testing

- **Backend:**  
  Run unit and integration tests using Maven/Gradle:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw test
  # or
  ./gradlew test
  ```

- **Frontend:**  
  Run frontend tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
